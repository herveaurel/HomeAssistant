1. error corrections :   
    - color of the badge calendar `bubble` in the `Activity card`  
    - color of the badge bin `bubble` in the `Activity card`  

2. Proximity  
The integration is now in the UI and removed from the YAML configuration.  
The entity names are different.  
    - I created a sensor template for each person: `sensor.proximity_NAME`  
    - I modified the person card to `person_complete_card` 
    - I modified the `proximity` variable in the dashboard card
